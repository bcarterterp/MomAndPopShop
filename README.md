# Welcome!

### This app is meant as your sandbox to explore the many areas of testing. The app idea is a simple one. There is a Shop that sells items and shoppers that can buy items. This will be expanded in later lessons (Wouldn't it bee cool if the shop gave discounts!?!), but feel free to play with your local version and have fun with it. The main point of this is to get you comfortable with testing!


Note: This repo is meant to help with learning how to test on Android. While some people would be comfortable looking through this alone, do not feel bad about reaching out to someone with Android knowledge to get ramped up on the Android framework.
